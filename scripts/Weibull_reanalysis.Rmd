### 1. Re-analysis

Below we outline the decisions we made in conducting our re-analysis. These mirror those made initially by Pearse et al. (2017).

* In calculation of Weibull estimarort, we required 11 dates for each species in each year; otherwise get an NA.
* Removed three unreasonable end estimates changed to NA's in the file below (AcMi 1976, DuHo 1976, CoLi 1996).
* Remove 8 species (`r paste0(spp_to_remove)`) with fewer than 19 years of data from species list in CaraDonna et al. (2014).
* $z$-score transformed the year variable so that the vector of unique years gets re-valued to improve stability of model fittig procedure.
