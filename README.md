### Overview

This repository contains code for the re-analysis of the Rocky Mountain dataset, originally analyzed and published in Pearse *et al.* (2017, *Nat Eco Evo*). Our analysis:

1. Reviews several problematic choices and technical errors introduced by Pearse *et al.* in their original analysis
2. Highlights how their published correction (Pearse *et al.* [2019]) fails to address several key issues previously raised during correspondence
3. Demonstrates how a correct re-analysis using the Weibull estimator alters the conclusions of Pearse *et al.* (2017) and brings them into concordance with the original findings published in CaraDonna *et al.* (2014).

The re-analysis is presented in the **R** Markdown document (`./scripts/Weibull_renanalysis.Rmd`) and its associated `html` file (`./output/Weibull_renanalysis.html`).
